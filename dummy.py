Task 2: The Age Group Explorer ðŸ‘¶ðŸ‘´
Goal: Create better age categories and see if it improves predictions

What to do:

Instead of the current age groups, create these new categories:

Baby (0-2 years)
Child (3-12 years)
Teen (13-19 years)
Adult (20-59 years)
Senior (60+ years)
Replace the existing age groups with your new ones

Compare the accuracy before and after

Questions to answer:

Did your new age groups improve accuracy?
Which age group had the highest survival rate?
Why might babies have different survival rates than other children?
Bonus: Create a bar chart showing survival rates by your new age groups
