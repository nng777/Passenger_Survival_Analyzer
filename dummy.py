Task 5: The Model Experimenter ðŸ§ª
Goal: Try a new machine learning algorithm

What to do:

Add a new model to test - Support Vector Machine (SVM):

from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Add to your models dictionary
'SVM': SVC(probability=True, random_state=42)
Compare all four models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)

Create a simple bar chart showing their accuracies

Questions to answer:

Which model performed best on your data?
Which model was fastest to train?
If you had to explain predictions to a non-technical person, which model would you choose and why?
